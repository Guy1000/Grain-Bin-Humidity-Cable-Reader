# Grain-Bin-Humidity-Cable-Reader
For reading SHT35 and DS28EA00 based humidity/temperature cables

  A very basic and crude example of how to bitbang I2C signals over the 2 PIO pins of the DS28EA00 to a SHT35 Relative Humidity Sensor. Very commonly used in commercial grain bin sensing cables. This can also be applied to most any I2C devices that support very low speeds.
